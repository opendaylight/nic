      "message": "Hi Alexis,\nThank you for your comment.\nThis is helpful!\nYour guess is correct. I should have removed the try catch close. But, since we were close to the code freeze, I asked David Bainbridge to merge the patch without changing this part.\nActually, it seems to me that the usage of try catch close are not appropriate in the file, and I think we need a big refactoring in Beryllium. I will address your comment in another patch.\nThanks!",
