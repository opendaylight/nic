/**
 * Interface Classifier
 * A classifier of network traffic which determines whether a policy will apply
 * to the given traffic. Each classifier is a collection of expressions, ANY of
 * which may match for the policy to be applied.
 *
 *
 * Put in more specific terms, a classifier has a list of Expressions [ e1, e2,
 * ...] which are logically combined with ORs: e1 OR e2 OR ...
 *
 * An Expression has a list of unique Terms: [ t1, t2 which are logically
 * combined with ANDs: t1 AND t2 AND ...
 *
 * A Term has a name/type and list of Intervals: [i1, i2, ...] which are
 * logically combined with ORs: i1 OR i2 OR ...
 *
 * An Interval has a start and an end.
 *
 * Putting all of this together, a classifier has this implied layout: c = e1 or
 * e2 or ... e = t1 AND t2 AND ... t = (name, i1 or i2 or ...)
 *
 * Here is a more concrete example: t.a = IP_PROT[10,30] or [50,60] t.b =
 * VLAN[1,5] e.1 = t.a AND t.b = (IP_PROT[10,30] or [50,60]) AND (VLAN[1,5])
 *
 * t.c = IP_PROT[1,5] t.d = VLAN[14] e.2 = t.c AND t.d = IP_PROT[1,5] and VLAN[14]
 *
 * c = e1 or e2 = (IP_PROT[10,30] or [50,60]) AND (VLAN[1,5]) OR IP_PROT[1,5]
 * and VLAN[14]
