      "message": "Just to be clear, a composed-graph will use only two edge types -- the conventional allow and deny -- which a underlying renderer can simply implement. The fine-grained intent edge types are needed only by input policy graphs from apps/users to declare their intents. \nIf a graph compiler can compose only two input graphs at a time, the compiler would generate intermediate graphs (e.g., a composed graph of the first two inputs) to eventually compose three or more input graphs. The intermediate graphs would also use the 4 types of intent edges.",
