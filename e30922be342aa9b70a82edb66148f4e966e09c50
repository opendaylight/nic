      "message": "I totally agree with you. And, I fixed it in the patch set 5.\n\nTo be honest, I noticed this issue before, but just skipped to change it.\n\nMy intention was as follows.\nThe main goal of this patch is to fix the problem on handling partial intents. But, when I fixed this method, I noticed the implementation of this method is not good. The code readability is bad. So I changed the implementation better in the patch. But, to make reviewing the patch easier, I tried to basically just move lines, since I thought a big change makes reviewing a little difficult.\n\nThat being said, your comment is absolutely correct. So I addressed it in the patch set 5.",
